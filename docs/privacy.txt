PRIVACY POLICY

Vital Mox
Frazier Software

At Frazier Software, we’re proud to say we collect absolutely nothing from you.
No sneaky data grabs, no creepy tracking, and definitely no “sharing with third
parties” (because, frankly, we have nothing to share).

This app doesn’t log you in, doesn’t care who you are, and doesn’t even rely on
the internet. It’s basically a digital hermit. We don’t do ad targeting, data
mining, or anything that would make a GDPR compliance officer wake up in a cold
sweat. Your privacy isn’t just safe with us—it’s practically overkill.

That said, we may collect some basic analytics on how the app behaves on your
device (think: “Did it crash? Did it work? Cool.”). If you’re one of those
“opt-out-of-everything” warriors, feel free to fiddle with your device settings,
cookies, host file, carrier pigeons, whatever floats your boat. We won’t stop you.

In short: We’ve got no data, no drama, and no desire to deal with the EU’s 47-page
rulebook. Enjoy the app!
